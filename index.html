        <p>
          Thank you for purchasing a license of this plugin.<br/>
          As you will see very quickly, this one differs enormously from the usual Wordpress extensions, in that it is a real very complete software which runs on your Wordpress site.<br/>
          This is intended to allow you to quickly and efficiently create all types of forms, including complex cost estimate forms that require various condition-based calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide aims to help you understand how this application works in order to allow you to create your forms with peace of mind.
        </p>

      <section data-section="installation">
        <h1>Installation</h1>

        <p>
          There are two ways to install a plugin on Wordpress.<br/>
          The easiest way is to install it directly from the backend. In some cases the installation may fail, so you have to install the plugin using FTP software.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Install from Wordpress</h2>
        <p>
          Click the "plugins" link in the Wordpress sidebar, click the "Add new" button, then the "Upload Plugin" button.<br/>
          Use the file upload field to upload the plugin file name "wp-estimation-payment-forms-builder.zip" .
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/screen_uploadPlugin.png" class="thumbnail" />

        <p>
          Once the plugin upload finished, activate it by clicking the "Activate Plugin" button .
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/screen_activatePlugin.png" class="thumbnail" />
        
        <h2>Install from FTP</h2>
        <p>
          You require a FTP software like Filezilla to be able to upload a plugin directly on the server.<br/>
          Your server has a FTP account (host,username,password) that was used to install Wordpress onside and that will be necessary to upload the plugin.<br/>
          First open the "wp-estimation-payment-forms-builder.zip" plugin file and extract its content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once connected to your server thanks to the FTP software of your choice, go to the folder "/www/wp-content/plugins/", open it and copy the folder "WP_Estimation_Form" inside.<br/>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Registration</h2>
        <p>
          Place the mouse cursor on the "E&P Form Builder" link in the Wordpress sidebar then click the "License" submenu link to open the license page of the plugin .<br/>
          Fill your purchase code in the field and click the "Verify" button to register your license and activate automatic updates .
        </p>

          <h1>Manage your forms</h1>
          <p>
            Click the "E&P Form Builder" link in the Wordpress sidebar to open the forms list panel.

          <h3>Main toolbar</h3>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_mainToolbar.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <p>
            At top right corner of the screen, you can see the main plugin toolbar. These buttons correspond to the elements that don't depend on a specific form :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Global settings :</b> This button opens the global settings of the plugin (like customer account page colors & texts, SMTP account etc...). <a href="#globalSettings" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-circle m-2 text-white"><i class="fas fa-info"></i></a></li>
            <li><b>Orders list :</b> This button allows you to view and edit the orders submitted thanks to your forms. <a href="#ordersManagement" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-circle m-2 text-white"><i class="fas fa-info"></i></a></li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Forms list</h3>
          <p>
            This table lists all the existing forms. <br/>
            Each form row contains some actions buttons. Simply move the cursor over them to see the action name :
          </p>

          <img src="assets/img/screen_formRowBtns.png" class="thumbnail" />
          
          <ul>
            <li><b>Edit this form :</b> this button allows you to edit the corresponding form</li>
            <li><b>Preview this form :</b> this button will open a new tab to allow you to test the form</li>

            <li><b>Duplicate this form :</b> This button allows you to duplicate the full form in one click. All the steps, items, links, variables are automatically duplicated. The prices & quantity calculations are automatically updated to use the new steps and items IDs.</li>
            <li><b>Form designer :</b> this button open the Form Designer tool, to allow you to customize the visual appearance of the form</li>
            <li><b>Delete this form : </b> this button will delete the selected form and the corresponding stored orders</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
             When you create or edit form, you access to the form edition page :
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_stepsManager.png" class="thumbnail" />

          <p>
            In the left part of the form edition toolbar you can see the navigation buttons that allow you to switch between the form edition tools :
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_formEditionTabs.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <ul>
            <li><b>Steps manager :</b> The steps manager allows you to manage the steps process of your form and create link conditions. <a href="#stepsManagement" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-circle m-2 text-white"><i class="fas fa-info"></i></a></li>
            <li><b>Last step :</b> This button allows you to edit the final static step of the form <a href="#stepsManagement" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-circle m-2 text-white"><i class="fas fa-info"></i></a></li>
            <li><b>Form settings :</b> The form settings contains all the options relative to the current form (features, email, colors, text, currency etc ...) <a href="#formSettings" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-circle m-2 text-white"><i class="fas fa-info"></i></a></li>
            <li><b>Variables :</b> This tool allows you to create variables that can be used in the calculations and custom content of your form <a href="#variables" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-circle m-2 text-white"><i class="fas fa-info"></i></a></li>

            <li><b>Designer :</b> open the Form Designer tool to allow you to customize the visual appearance of the form</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The right part of the form edition toolbar shows the actions relative to the current opened panel :
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_formEditionActions.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <p>
            These buttons change when you navugate to a different tool panel by using the navigation buttons.
          </p>

          
        </section>
        <section id="stepsManagement" data-section="stepsManagement">
          <h1>Steps manager</h1>
          <p>
            Edit or create a a form to access to the form edition page :
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_stepsManager.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <p>
            The steps manager is the panel opened by default. It shows all the steps of the form and allows you to link and create conditions to show each one depending on the wanted conditions.<br/>
            A final static step is always added at end of the form, after the configured steps. To create a single step form, you simply need to edit the last step without creating additional steps.<br/>
            Move the cursor over a step circle to see the possible actions buttons :
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_stepCircleActions.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <ul>
            <li><b>Define as start step :</b> Click this button to set this step as first step of the form</li>
            <li><b>Start a link to another step :</b> Click this button to create a link that goes from this step to another one</li>
            Youcan freely define the conditions of each link, so the plugin will detect the valid link to call the good next step</li>
            <li><b>Edit this step :</b> Click this button to edit th content of the selected step <a href="#stepEdition" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-circle m-2 text-white"><i class="fas fa-info"></i></a></li>
            <li><b>Duplicate this step :</b> This button allows you to duplicate the selected step and all its content in one click</li>
            <li><b>Remove this step :</b> This button allows youto delete the selected step and its content</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            To link two steps, simply click the "Start a link to another step" button on the wanted step, then click the target step circle :
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_link.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <p>
            The pencil icon at middle of the link allows you to define the conditions of this link.<br/>
            When the "Next step" button is clicked in a step, the plugin verifies the conditions of all the links that start from this step.<br/>
            If there is a valid link, it will open its target step as next step. Otherwise it will show the final step.<br/>
            If there are several valid links, it will select the one that has the less conditions defined.
          </p>
         
        </section>
        
        <section id="stepEdition" data-section="stepEdition">
          <h1>Step edition</h1>
          <p>
            Click the "Edit this step" button on a step circle from the "Steps manager" panel to open the step edition panel :
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_stepBuilder.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <p>
            The step layout is made up of rows. Rows are made up of columns, and columns contains the items components.<br/>
            You can add new rows by clicking the green "+" buttons at top and bottom of the step content : 
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_stepBuilderAddRow.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <p>
            Simply move the cursor over a row to see its edition menu :
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_stepBuilderRowMenu.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <p>
            Simply click the "+" button  you to add a new column in this row.<br/>
            You can change the size of a column from its toolbar that is displayed when you move the cursor over it, and add new components inside by clicking its gray "+" buttons : 
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_stepBuilderColumnMenu.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <p>
            In the same way, simply move the cursor over a component to see its menu and edit it by clicking the pencil icon :
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_stepBuilderItemMenu.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <p>
            Components and columns can be moved and sorted by using drag & drop to create the wanted layout.<br/>
            To be able to delete a column, you first need to remove the components it contains.<br/>
            Simply click the pencil icon in the wanted component toolbar to edit its options. <a href="#itemEdition" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-circle m-2 text-white"><i class="fas fa-info"></i></a>

          <p>
            All the options displayed in these tabs are dynamic and can depend on each other.<br/>

            You simply need to move your cursor over an option to see more information about it.<br/>

          </p>
          <ul>

            <li><b>Type : </b> This option allows you to change the type of the selected component without losing the values filled in the different options, allowing you to revert your choice keeping all the settings made.</li>
            <li><b>Radio group name : </b> By filling the same value in the "Radio group name" option of several components, the user will be able to select only one of them at same time</li>
            <li><b>Price calculation : </b>This option allows you to configure a dynamic unit price for the selected component. <a href="#calculations" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-circle m-2 text-white"><i class="fas fa-info"></i></a> </li>
            <li><b>Quantity calculation :</b> This option works exactly like the price calculation option, but it defines the default quantity of the selected component </li>
            <li><b>Modify a variable :</b> This option works like the price and the quantity calculation options, but its result defines the value of a custom variable <a href="#variables" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-circle m-2 text-white"><i class="fas fa-info"></i></a></li>
            
            <li><b>Apply reductions on quantities : </b> This option allows you to define a different unit price depending on the quantity filled by th user. To use it, fill the wanted minimum quantity and the new unit price in the fields then click the "Add reduction" button</li>
            <li><b>Type of information : </b> This option specific to the text fields allows the plugin to know the kind of data collected. It is used to detect the customer's email, but also to be able to send the contact information to Zapier, MailChimp etc ...</li>
            <li><b>Validation mask :</b> This option is displayed when the "Type" option is set to "Text field" and the "Validation" option set to "Mask". It allows you to configure custom validation masks. You can find documentation about masks on the website of the used jQuery plugin : <a href="https://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/docs.html">https://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/docs.html</a></li>
        
            <li><b>Show in email/summary : </b> When this option is enabled, and if this item is selected, it will be displayed in the facultative summary displayed in the final step, and in the one sent by email to the admin and the customer when the form is submitted</li>
            <li><b>Tooltip text : </b> The text filled in this option will be displayed in a tooltip when the user will move the cursor over this component</li>
            <li><b>Display price in title : </b> If the component uses a static price, this price will be displayed in its title. But if its price is defined by a calculation, the price will be displayed in the title only when the component will be selected.</li>

          <h1>Prices & quantity calculations</h1>
          <p>
            Both prices calculations, quantity calculations and variables calculation use the same awesome system :
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/screen_priceCalculation.png" class="thumbnail" />
          <p>
            The custom calculation system uses <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp" target="_blank">JavaScript language</a>.<br/>
            It supports any Javascript syntax and functions, like the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp" target="_blank">Math object ones</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the Javascript language, shortcodes are added which are specific to this plugin.<br/>
            The <b>[price]</b> shortcode is the result of the calculation, so a calculation looks like this :
          </p>
          <pre>[price] = 110.00</pre>
          <p>
          The other shortcodes are used to recover the value, price or quantity of any item or step of the form and use it in the calculation.<br/>
          You don't need to write them manually : simply click the "Add a value" button above the calculation field to visually select the wanted element and attribute.
          The plugin will automatically generate the corresponding shortcode in the calculation field :
        </p>
        <pre>[price] = [item-1_value]</pre>
        <p>
          The main operators to use are :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>+ : </b>addition</li>
          <li><b>- : </b>substraction</li>
          <li><b>* : </b>multiplication</li>
          <li><b>/ : </b>division</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To create conditions, click the "Add a condition" button to access to the condition panel :
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/screen_calculationConditions.png" class="thumbnail" />
        <p>
          Simply use the "<b>Add a condition</b>" button and the conditions dropdowns to create the wanted conditions.<br/>
          You can also choose if all the conditions must be filled, or if only one of them must be filled to consider the condition as true, by using the dropdown placed at top of the conditions list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the "<b>Save</b>" button clicked on the conditions panel, the plugin automatically generates the condition code in the calculation field :
        </p>
        <pre>[price] = 10
          if([item-1_isChecked] && [item-2_value] < 25) {

          }</pre>
        <p>
          Simply fill the wanted conditional price between the two braces : 
        </p>
        <pre>[price] = 10
          if([item-1_isChecked] && [item-2_value] < 25) {
            [price] = 20
          }</pre>
        <p>
          In this example, the default unit cost of the current item will be $10, but if the item 1 is selected and if the value filled in the item 2 is inferior to 25, its price will become $20.
        </p>
        <p>
          As explained, custom calculations support any JS syntax, so you can even create conditions in conditions, and use "else" statement :
        </p>
        <pre>if([item-1_isChecked]) {
            if([item-2_isChecked]){
              [price] = 20
            } else {
              [price] = 10              
            }
          }</pre>
        <p>
          The "<b>Add a distance</b>" button will be available only if the "Google Maps API key" option is filled in the form settings.<br/>
          It allows you to recover the number of miles/km or the travel duration between the addresses that come from the text fields of your form.<br/>
          The plugin uses the "Type of information" option of the text fields of the form to detect the available address fields.<br/>
          The result will be a shortcode like [distance-1-2] in the calculation code, that will return the calculated distance when this calculation will be executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "<b>Date difference</b>" button allows you to recover the number of days between the dates selected in two datepickers of the form, and use it in your calculation.
        </p>

            You can choose to modify a variable when a specific component is selected by using the "Modify a variable" option in the "Price & Quantity" tab of the target component edition panel.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            The variables values can be displayed in "Custom content" components and in email content by using the "Add dybnamic value" button in the editor toolbar.
